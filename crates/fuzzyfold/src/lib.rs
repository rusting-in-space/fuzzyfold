//! # fuzzyfold
//!
//! The main entry point for the fuzzyfold nucleic acid folding package, with
//! interfaces to multiple crates that are organized as a workspace. At this
//! level, you can also find argument parsers for the binaries shipped with the
//! fuzzyfold package.
//!
//! This crate re-exports the main functionality from its submodules.
